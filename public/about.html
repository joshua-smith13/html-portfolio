<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my page,</h3>
  <p>I'm Joshua Smith and I'm going to tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<p>I started my first IT job in 2022, as an IT Support Specialist I, with Centene. I'm still currently employed with Centene as an IT Support Specialist.
  This job has been very enlighting and a great start into IT for me. However, I am pursuing to further my career into IT, more into Coding.
  As such, I've taken the first steps of teaching myself coding through Udemy.</p>

<p>From my understanding this is my first of several coding projects. I'll be doing to help learn and understand the different coding languages.
  I hope through my actions and the fruits of my labor, I am able to display my hard work and dedication. I take pride in all of the work that I do, 
  and strive to better improve myself. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading this little bit of information, I have shared about me. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.</p>
  <p>- Joshua Smith</p>
