<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed this movie. 
The Acting was beautifully done, and the comedic beat was wonderful.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Grew up watching this as one of my first anime movies. 
Studio Ghibili made this beautiful piece of a movie.</p>

<h3>Space Balls</h3>
<p>A Comedy poking fun of Star Wars. 
I really enjoyed it, though I don't know to describe it was funny to me. 
It has Mel Brooks in it.</p>

<h3>The Hunt for Red October</h3>
<p>This is a nice action packed movie. It's a bit older than recent movie's but I very much enjoy it still.
You have Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Sam Neill, Tim Curry, and James Earl Jones.
